1. How do you stay updated about topics in Flutter/Dart and active in the community? (Discord/Slack/MeetUps/Twitter)
A) I follow Flutter channels/servers on Discord, Twitter and Youtube. As well as checking the documentation from time to time.

2. Your most used IDE/keyboard shortcuts when coding. (for Flutter/Dart)
A) I use formatting, snippets, and pubspec assistant shortcuts in VSCode.

3. How do you approach responsiveness when coding an entire screen? (You can attach code snippet for better explanation).
A) I generally use MediaQuery along with Expanded and flex properties if the screen doesn't have complex UI components. Making use of the
 fractional part of the screen in sizing the widget and its children. As of now I am getting used to using the various types of widgets provided by Flutter UI Toolkit itself.
 Such as the LayoutBuilder, FractionallySizedBox etc.
