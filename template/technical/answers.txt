1. Attach a pubspec.yaml file from one of your past flutter projects.
A) Add file to "technical" folder

2. What is your understanding of the term “State Management” when talking about Flutter App Development. Explain it in your own words.
A) State Management is data initialization, 
 it's manipulation, wether the data is mutable or immutable, and at last disposing 
 it at the end of the flutter activity lifecycle. When talking about the data flow, all 
 things are considered. Whether the data is being used in the same screen/activity or 
 passed down to the childer widgets or sub screens, in other cases it could be used in 
 the whole other widget tree not related to same parent widget.

3. When/Where do you usually encounter bugs in your development process?
A) I occasionally encounter bugs in making the UI responsive to each device size. When
 the keyboard appears on screen, or sometimes when one of the widget overflows due to less constraints.
