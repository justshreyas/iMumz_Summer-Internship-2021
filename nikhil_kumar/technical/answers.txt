2. What is your understanding of the term “State Management” when talking about Flutter App Development. Explain it in your own words.
A) State Management in flutter  in my words is to manage and change(ui,working,everthing)in each states and after 
   screen is get rendered than a new state is reached and how it should look and work ,to manage all these 
   states is state management ie, in one of my projet i have done like everyone is google sign in we can see who is online,
   and who is offline.  

3. When/Where do you usually encounter bugs in your development process?
A) The most common bugs that almost everytime come is renderflex because many times its pixels gets overflowed
   and when i am working with firebase the most bugs is with data received or not some time due to single word 
   whole bug was there and then usuall bug is when we are passing data from one class to another(some times 
   stateful ,sometimes stateless).
